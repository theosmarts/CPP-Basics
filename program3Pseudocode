Variables - lines, words, characters


Loop through all the characters in the file while we havent reached end of file
for every character encountered, increase the count of characters
If we encounter a new line, increase the count of lines
start with the state being outside a word
if while still looping through the file, we encounter a space, tab or new line, we are still outside a word.
If we encounter a character that is not a space, tab or new line, we are inside a word
increase the count of words
continue until we encounter a space, tab or new line, only then, we will now be outside the word
